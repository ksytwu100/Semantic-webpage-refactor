Semantic webpage refactor

The Semantic webpage refactor was created based on the important aspects of web accessibility and semantics. This challenge is to make the CSS and HTML codes more efficient by consolidating CSS elements, selectors, and properties, and by improving the semantic structure of the HTM so that the web will be more beneficial to people with disability and businesses.
